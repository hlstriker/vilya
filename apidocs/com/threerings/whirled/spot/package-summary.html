<div class="block">Extends the Whirled services with the notion of locations, clusters,
    coordinates and orientation.

    <p> The basic Whirled services facilitate a game that provides a
      connected set of scenes and the ability for the bodies to move from
      a scene to its neighboring scenes. The Spot package extends those
      services by providing the notion of locations within scenes which a
      body can occupy and which, while occupied, cannot be occupied by
      other bodies.
    </p>

    <p> The philosophy is that a game that uses these services wants to
      create a constrained universe where a body cannot simply stand
      anywhere on the screen, but can only stand in a set of predefined
      locations.  This is a simplified mechanism for providing finer
      grained locality management, such that expensive distance monitoring
      algorithms need not be used to determine who can interact (speak)
      with others in a particular scene. For many games, the overhead of
      tracking each users' position in near-realtime coupled with a
      complex message broadcasting system that dispatches messages to
      users in geometric proximity to one another is serious overkill and
      does not add sufficient value to the game to merit inclusion.
    </p>

    <p><b>Locations and clusters</b><br>

      The Spot package provides a functional approximation in the form of
      clusters of locations, with predefined coordinates, that are
      sufficiently proximal that bodies in that cluster of locations can
      all speak to one another. The locations for a particular scene are
      specified in advance which serves the additional purpose of putting
      a limit on the number of bodies that can be standing (and
      participating) in a particular scene. This puts a natural upper
      bound on the amount of network traffic that will be generated by the
      need to broadcast scene updates to all occupants of a scene.
    </p>

    <p> Locations also serve as entry and exit points for a scene,
      providing a means both for the graphical user interface to identify
      the location at which bodies enter and exit a scene as well as
      providing a spatial context for the connections between scenes
      (i.e. the exit to the scene to the north can be located in the
      northward part of a scene display).
    </p>

    <p><b>Orientation</b><br>

      Locations define a notion of orientation which is assigned a priori,
      along with the coordinates of the location and which can be
      interpreted by the graphical display as the direction that body
      sprites should face when standing on that location.  Clusters of
      locations can be constructed such that all of the bodies standing in
      that cluster appear to be facing one another which provides visible
      reinforcement that members of the cluster can "hear" the
      conversation, while members of other clusters cannot. The
      orientation of entry and exit locations are also useful in
      establishing an initial orientation for a body sprite that enters a
      scene based on the visualization of the entrance mechanism (i.e. if
      they appear to enter through the door, the body sprite should be
      oriented as if it just walked in the proper direction through the
      door).
    </p>

    <p> Because the Spot services redefine the scope at which speak
      messages are normally distributed (the Crowd services would, by
      default, have speak messages dispatched to everyone in the entire
      scene because the scene is a place and the default chat mechanisms
      dispatch speak messages to all occupants of a place), it defines an
      additional communication mode known as shouting, which conveys the
      message to everyone in the entire scene.
    </p>

    <p><b>Portals</b><br>

      Portals are a combination of locations and the standard Whirled
      notion of neighboring scenes. They contain the coordinates to which
      a body sprite would traverse prior to exiting to a neighboring scene
      (generally so that they appear to walk to whatever visual
      representation of the portal is provided by the scene, like a door
      or perhaps simply the edge of the scene). Conversely, they represent
      the coordinates at which a body arriving from same neighboring scene
      would appear in the displayed scene.
    </p>

    <p><b>Example display</b><br>

      This is an example of how these concepts might look in a game
      providing top-down 2D display of its scenes. <br>
    </p>

    <center>
      <img align="center" src="images/scene.png" alt="Example scene image">
    </center>

    <p> The arrows would, of course, not be rendered but are shown to
      indicate the presence of locations (and portals) and their
      associated orientation information.
